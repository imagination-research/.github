## Welcome to Imagination-Research

We are an informal research "organization" driven by common interests, exploring a wide range of topics. Learn more about us at [this group website](http://nics-effalg.com/).

It's hard to say what specific topics we are focusing on, as we are concerned with a range of intrinsic problems that we think are preventing current techniques from reaching AGI.
And we're continuously trying out and evolving our perspectives on what problems are intrinsic, as well as what pathways might be promising and worth trying out.

If you find our style of research and concrete ideas interesting, email us to discuss interesting thoughts or collaborate. We're curious about many problems and love ideas from many fields!
